# PredictGender_from_uniquename
This project contains Python code that tries to predict gender (female or male), from a list of more than 300K unique names, where there are simple names of only 1 name, names made up of 2 names and names of more than 2 compound names.  In addition there are names that could be 50% female and 50% male (composite names), such as "Jos√© Ana"
